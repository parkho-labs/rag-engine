This relationship is Newton's second law of motion.\n\nMathematically, we write:\nF_net = ma\n\nwhere F_net is the net force (in Newtons), m is mass (in kg), and a is acceleration (in m/s²).",

Vehicle Safety: Airbags reduce the force on passengers during collisions by increasing the time over which momentum changes, thus reducing acceleration.\n\n2.

Sports: Athletes use Newton's second law when they push harder against the ground to achieve greater acceleration when sprinting.",
